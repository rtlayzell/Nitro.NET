## Nitro.NET
---

Nitro.NET supplies a set of class libraries to read/write the contents of Nintendo DS ROMS ("Games")
into easily consumable .NET components.  The intent is to allow developers to easily construct tools 
for home-brew development on the NDS platform.

The library is developed based on the limited information I can find on the internet.
